"""Part 2 proof: the job-hunt tracker answers ONLY in composed interfaces.

Drives the real gateway exactly the way the ``/app`` shell does — POST a goal to
``/v1/agent/runs`` with ``respond_as="ui"``, read the composed interface from
``/v1/runs/{id}/composed`` — and carries a conversation across three turns, where
a tap in one interface shapes the next.

Every identity in here is synthetic.
